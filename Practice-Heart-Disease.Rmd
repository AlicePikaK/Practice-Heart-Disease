## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


1. First, loading packages and data set (downloaded as .csv file from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/heart-disease-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county).
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(pander)
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, prompt=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment="", results='hide')

Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults_35_by_State_Territory_and_County <- read.csv("~/RStudio (Projects & Practice)/Practice-Heart-Disease/Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State_Territory_and_County.csv")

#or
load("~/RStudio (Projects & Practice)/Practice-Heart-Disease/Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults_35_by_State_Territory_and_County")

View(Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults_35_by_State_Territory_and_County)


```


2. Some basic exploratory data analyses.
```{r, echo=FALSE}

file <- Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults_35_by_State_Territory_and_County
names(file)
head(file)
tail(file)

file$GeographicLevel
table(file$LocationAbbr)
summary(file)

#Don't really know what's going on here
as.numeric(file$LocationAbbr)
hist(as.numeric(file$LocationAbbr), xlab="State (by number code)")

#2 Problems:
##Returns NA bc there's supposed to be an index number in the bracket
###Wrong column name, it should be LocationsDesc
file$LocationAbbr["Aleutians East"] 

file$LocationDesc[100]
file$LocationDesc[seq(1,100, by=5)]

```


3. Examining the relationships between heart disease mortality and various factors.

```{r, echo=FALSE}



```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
